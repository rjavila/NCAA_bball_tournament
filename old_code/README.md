# Old code 

This is old code that was used in the MarsMadness yearly bracket
game. Descriptions below.

`scrape_website.py`
: Code used to scrape the CBS Sport website for each players selections. They changed the format of the website and it is no longer possible to scrape and now all the picks have to be imported by hand into an excel spreadsheeet (bastards).

`cumulative_points.py`
: Previous version of code used to calculate points. This was used prior to 2024 (I think).

`daily_picks.py`
: This is really really old code. Not even sure how it works anymore. Looks like it was reading through html tables that had been downloaded with other code.
